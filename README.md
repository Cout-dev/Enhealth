Early diagnosis plays a vital role in preventing and managing health-related 
conditions, ultimately improving overall well-being. ENHEALTH is an AIpowered health prediction system designed to assess the likelihood of common 
health concerns such as stress levels, diabetes, lung cancer, sleep disorders, and 
COVID-19 risk. Multiple machines learning algorithms, including classification 
and regression models, were trained, tested, and evaluated to identify the most 
accurate models for each disease. These optimized models were then deployed 
using a Flask-based API, ensuring efficient integration with the web platform. 
The front-end, built using React, provides a user-friendly interface where 
individuals can input relevant health parameters, such as age, heart rate, sleep 
duration, and other lifestyle factors. The system processes this data in real time 
and predicts the likelihood of a specific health condition. If a potential risk is 
detected, ENHEALTH offers actionable recommendations, such as consulting a 
healthcare professional for further evaluation. Additionally, for moderate or lowrisk cases, the system provides useful self-care resources, including scientificallybacked YouTube videos or Wikipedia articles related to the condition. 
By integrating advanced machine learning techniques with modern web 
technologies, ENHEALTH aims to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence 
and healthcare. The platform empowers users with valuable health insights, 
enabling them to take proactive measures toward a healthier lifestyle. Through 
real-time analysis and personalized recommendations, the system enhances 
accessibility to early detection, making predictive healthcare more efficient and 
user-centric.
